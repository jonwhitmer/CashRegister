# Cash Register Object Project

## Description
The "Cash Register Object Project" is a C++ console application that simulates a cash-only register system. It utilizes object-oriented programming principles to manage inventories of items and denominations, process orders, and handle transactions. This project is aimed at demonstrating the application of C++ in creating practical, real-world applications.

## Features
- Item and denomination management.
- Order processing.
- Transaction handling.
- Cash-only simulation.

## How to Use
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler. If using g++, the command would be something like: `g++ -o CashRegister CashRegister.cpp`.
2. Run the compiled program, typically via: `./CashRegister` on Unix-like systems or `CashRegister.exe` on Windows.
3. Follow the interactive prompts to perform transactions, manage inventory, and simulate the cash register operations.

## Installation
